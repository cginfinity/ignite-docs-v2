## Copy ID Part From Sheet

Take the ID part from the https link of the spreadsheet. The sheet ID can be found in the URL of your google sheet, for example in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eMwVSUK-vXWleH8YDLVH655ktRY_Ny0zHZxkzWxt1Jk/edit#gid=0. The ID would be 1eMwVSUK-vXWleH8YDLVH655ktRY_Ny0zHZxkzWxt1Jk. 

This information will be used to **[Set up Google Sheet Connector](/docs/connectors/google-sheets/usage#set-up-google-sheet-connector-properties)**.
