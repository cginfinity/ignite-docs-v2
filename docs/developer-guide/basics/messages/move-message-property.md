## Discussion

The <code class="node">Change</code> node can be used to move a property of a message.

It can be done as two separate actions in the <code class="node">Change</code> node;
first using a Set action to copy the property to its new location and then a Delete
action to remove the original.

Alternatively, the node supports a Move action that does it in one step.
