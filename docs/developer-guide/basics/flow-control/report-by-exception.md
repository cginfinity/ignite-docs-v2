title: Drop Messages That Have Not Changed Value
sidebar_label: Report By Exception
---

## Problem

You want to drop a message if the value of its payload has not changed since the
last message. For example, you have a sensor sending the state of a switch at
regular intervals and you only want to know when the value has changed.

## Solution

Use the <code class="node">RBE</code> node (Report By Exception) to block messages
unless its value has changed.

## Discussion

The <code class="node">RBE</code> can be used to drop messages unless their value
has changed. This is useful for detecting changes.

If the property being checked is a number, the node can also be configured with
a threshold for how much the value must change for the message to be passed on.
