title: Perform an Operation on Each Element in an Array
sidebar_label: Operate on Array
---

## Problem

You want to perform an operation on every element in an array. For example,
given an array of numbers, you want to round each value to the nearest integer.

## Solution

The <code class="node">Split</code> node can be used to send a message for every
element in the array. It can be followed by the nodes needed to operate on the
individual elements, followed by a <code class="node">Join</code> node to recombine
them back into a single array.

## Discussion

In other programming environments, this task would be accomplished by creating a loop
over the elements of the array.

In Ignite, the way to achieve the same thing is to turn the single message containing
the array into a stream of messages that can be processed individually and finally
recombine them back into one message.

The <code class="node">Split</code>/<code class="node">Join</code> node pair are
commonly used together to achieve this. The <code class="node">Split</code> node
adds the `msg.parts` property to each message in the stream which allows the
<code class="node">Join</code> node to properly reassemble the original message.
