title: Trigger a Flow if a Message Isnâ€™t Received After a Defined Time
sidebar_label: Trigger Timeout
---

## Problem

You want a flow to be triggered if a message is not received after a defined time.
For example, you expect to receive a sensor reading every 5 seconds and need to know
if it fails to arrive.

## Solution

Use the <code class="node">Trigger</code> node to detect when a message has not
arrived after a defined interval.

## Discussion

In the example flow, the top branch represents the normal flow of the messages.
They also get passed to the <code class="node">Trigger</code> node on a second
branch of the flow.

The <code class="node">Trigger</code> node is configured to initially send nothing,
then to wait for 5 seconds before sending a `"timeout"` message. The option to
extend the delay if new messages arrive is also selected. This means as long as
messages continue to arrive, the node will not do anything. Once 5 seconds passes
after the last message to arrive, it will send on the `"timeout"` message.
