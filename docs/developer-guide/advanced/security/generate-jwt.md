## Problem

You want to generate a JSON web token for authentication.

## Solution

Drag and drop an <code class="node">Http in</code> node to create an endpoint to receive the http requests.
Use a <code class="node">Function</code> node and set some data as payload for the JWT.
Drag and drop a <code class="node">JWT</code> node and define your JWT configuration.
Select "Generate" as the action from the dropdown.
Use another <code class="node">Function</code> node to send the token as an access_token back to the client

### Configure Setting

- #### Open Properties

    Double click on the node "jwt" and open the properties.

## Get Access Token
Copy runtime URL from menu.

Paste the URL in new tab, without press enter. Below is the sample runtime. Your runtime URL will be different.

https://ignite-demo.herokuapp.com/

Now add the demo JWT end point as mention in the above example with the Runtime URL you just copied.

https://ignite-demo.herokuapp.com/jwt/generate

Hit enter to go to the URL. You will get access token

## Discussion

This flow generates a JWT from the given payload and sends it back to the client as the access_token.

JWTs are helpful in authorizing users requesting for a particular resource.
