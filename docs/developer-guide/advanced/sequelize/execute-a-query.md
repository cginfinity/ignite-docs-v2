## Problem

You want to execute a SQL query using Ignite-Sequelize node.

## Solution

Drag and drop an <code class="node">Inject</code> node to start the flow.
Use a <code class="node">Sequelize</code> node and draw a wire from inject node to <code class="node">sequelize</code> node.
Use the config node inside <code class="node">Sequelize</code> node to define your database configuration.
Drag and drop a <code class="node">Debug</code> node and connect to sequelize node to print out the response in the debug window.

## Discussion

Sequelize node can be used to connect to a variety of Databases.

In the example flow, we are executing a simple select statement using a <code class="node">Sequelize</code> node.

The <code class="node">Catch</code> receives the error which passes the message back to the <code class="node">Function</code> node to an error response.

You can also supply query via payload by ticking the checkbox against **"Use Query From Payload"**.
