## About

breakpoint allows you to pause the execution of the flow and helps you to explore your JSON data (msg.payload) directly into the <a href="https://jsonata.cgignite.io/" target="_blank">Ignite JSONata Explorer</a>.

## Running Status


The <b>breakpoint</b> node initially starts with status <b>Stopped</b>.

When you initiate a message within it, the node changes to status <b>Running</b>.

Once the node finishes the timeout value and stops running service, the node changes to status <b>Resumed</b>.
